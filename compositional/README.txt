The compositional module implements solvers for multicomponent where PVT-properties are computed using equations of state. The module contains a set of models for solving generic cubic equations of state to predict phase behavior and fluid properties, as well as flow and transport solvers that make use of these models. The standard set of solvers use Peng-Robinson equation of state for PVT and Lohrenz-Bray-Clark correlation for the viscosity and has been extensively validated against other well known compositional simulators.
