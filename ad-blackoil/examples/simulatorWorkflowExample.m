%% Workflow example for MRST-AD
% This example aims to show the complete workflow for creating, running and
% analyzing a simulation model. Unlike the other examples, we will create
% all features of the model manually to get a self-contained script without
% any input files required.
%
% The model we will setup is a two phase oil/water model with some
% compressibility and multiple wells. We begin by setting up the grid and
% rock structures. The grid is created by "makeModel3", which creates a
% structured model with intersecting faults.
%
% We also define a layered permeability structure, with 300, 100 and 500
% darcy in the lower, middle and top layers respectively.
%
% Note that this example shows a simple conceptual model designed to show
% the workflow rather than a problem representing a realistic scenario in
% terms of well locations and fluid physics.

% Define grid
grdecl = makeModel3([50, 50, 5], [1000, 1000, 5]*meter);
G = processGRDECL(grdecl);
G = computeGeometry(G);

% Set up permeability based on K-indices
[I, J, K] = gridLogicalIndices(G);

top = K < G.cartDims(3)/3;
lower = K > 2*G.cartDims(3)/3;
middle = ~(lower | top);

px = ones(G.cells.num, 1);
px(lower) = 300*milli*darcy;
px(middle) = 100*milli*darcy;
px(top) = 500*milli*darcy;

% Introduce anisotropy by setting K_x = 10*K_z.
perm = [px, px, 0.1*px];
rock = makeRock(G, perm, 0.3);
%% Define wells and simulation schedule
% We will insert three producers, operating at fixed bottom hole pressure
% and perforated throughout all layers of the model along with a single
% injector injecting one pore volume over 10 years (the total simulation
% length). We also set up a schedule consisting of 5 small control steps
% initially, followed by 25 larger steps. We keep the well controls fixed
% throughout the simulation.

simTime = 10*year;
nstep = 25;
refine = 5;

pv = poreVolume(G, rock);
injRate = 1*sum(pv)/simTime;

% Place wells
offset = 10;

                'Name', 'P1', 'comp_i', [1 0], 'Val', 250*barsa, 'Type', 'bhp');
W = verticalWell(W, G, rock, G.cartDims(1) - offset, G.cartDims(2) - offset, [],...
                'Name', 'P2', 'comp_i', [1 0], 'Val', 250*barsa, 'Type', 'bhp');
W = verticalWell(W, G, rock, offset, G.cartDims(2) - offset, [], ...
                'Name', 'P3', 'comp_i', [1 0], 'Val', 250*barsa, 'Type', 'bhp');
% Injectors
W = verticalWell(W, G, rock, floor(G.cartDims(1)/2) + 4, floor(G.cartDims(1)/2) - 3, 1,...
                'Name', 'Injector', 'comp_i', [1 0], 'Val', injRate, 'Type', 'rate');

% Compute the timesteps
startSteps = repmat((simTime/(nstep + 1))/refine, refine, 1);
restSteps =  repmat(simTime/(nstep + 1), nstep, 1);
timesteps = [startSteps; restSteps];
% Set up the schedule containing both the wells and the timesteps
schedule = simpleSchedule(timesteps, 'Wells', W);

%% Set up simulation model
% We set up a two phase simulation model based on automatic
% differentiation. We define a three phase fluid (with properties given for
% oil, water and gas) but the model will only use the oil and water values.
% Once we have defined the fluid, we further modify the oil compressibility
% by changing the bO-factor to have some constant compressibility using
% an anonymous function of pressure (using the standard Matlab builtin exp)
% to get a function on the form
%
% $Â b_o(p) = b_0 e^{(p - p_0) c} $
%
% We then pass the fundamental structures (grid, rock and fluid) onto the
% two-phase oil/water model constructor.

%% Define initial state
% Once we have a model, we need to set up a initial state. We set up a very
% simple initial state. MRST uses water, oil, gas ordering internally, so
% in this case we have water in the first column and oil in the second for
% the saturations. We let the bottom part of the reservoir be completely
% water filled, and the top completely oil filled.

% (mathematical description of how to advance the solution) and the initial
% solution, we can simulate the problem.

%% Create a upscaled, coarser model

%% Split blocks over the faultlines
% We see that several coarse blocks cross the fault lines. To get
% hexahedral coarse blocks, we create a grid where the faults act as

%
% Afterwards, we show the new partition and highlight blocks created due to
% the modification of the fault.

%% Upscale the model and run the coarser problem
% We can now directly upscale the model, schedule and initial state
% automatically. By default, the upscaling routines uses the simplest
% possible options, i.e. harmonic averaging of permeabilities. It is
% possible to use more advanced options, but for the purpose of this
% example we will use the defaults.

% Once we have a upscaled model, we can again simulate the new schedule and
% observe that the time taken is greatly reduced.

%% Compute flow diagnostics
% As an alternative to looking at well curves, we can also look at the flow
% diagnostics of the models. Flow diagnostics are simple routines based on
% time-of-flight and tracer equations, which aim to give a qualitative

% states as a snapshot for both the fine and coarse model and compute
% time-of-flight and well tracers.

%% Plot total arrival times
% We plot the sum of forward and backwards time of flight, showing which
% regions have large amounts of flow. Large values indicate that a cell
% has little flow going through it.

% Since the values vary by several orders of magnitude, we take the
% $log_{10}$ transform before plotting. We also use the same color axis to
