Module containing the object oriented framework for solvers based on automatic differentiation (MRST AD-OO). This module by itself does not contain any complete simulators it implements the common framework used for many other modules. For instance, the ad-blackoil module contains models for the the black-oil equations that inherit all basic features from ad-core.
